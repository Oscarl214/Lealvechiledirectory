The Vehicle Maintenance Tracker is a private, full-stack application exclusively designed for my family to track the maintenance history of our vehicles. It provides a convenient maintenance guide to help users identify tasks and allows them to log the type of maintenance along with the date it was completed. Built with Next.js and secured with NextAuth for authentication, this application offers a secure and user-friendly experience. By keeping the site exclusive, it ensures that our family can easily update and monitor vehicle maintenance, solving the issue of forgetting service dates and keeping our cars in top shape.

- **Home Page:** Features a dynamic Hero section with a brief introduction to the site's purpose, along with two prominent call-to-action buttons: one for browsing available vehicles and the other for directing users to their selected vehicle after logging in. Following this, a Features section highlights the application's key functionalities, using informative cards that explain each feature and provide clear instructions on how to use the platform.
- **Vehicle Selection Page:** Displays all available vehicles through visually engaging cards, each showcasing a vehicle's image and key details like transmission type, drivetrain, and city MPG. Each card includes a call-to-action button allowing users to easily add the vehicle to their profile.
- **My Vehicle Page:** Showcases the user’s selected vehicles, featuring an enlarged image of each vehicle and two action buttons—one that reveals the car's full stats and another that displays its maintenance history.

This is followed by a maintenance form, enabling users to log the type, task, and date of their vehicle’s maintenance.
